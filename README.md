# Uncharted Realms
Uncharted Realms is a collectible card game where the cards are generated and re-balanced entirely by machine learning. Every card in the game is brand new, never seen before. As battles go on, the game is observing play patterns and card performance to keep re-balancing itself and keeping the game fair.
